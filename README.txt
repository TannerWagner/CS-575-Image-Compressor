-This project implements the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform on two grayscale images (Lena & Mandrill)

-The project presentation presents a theoretical and numerical framework diving fairly deep into the mathematics behind the operator itself, discretization, numerical impplementation, metrics, and a brief comparison with the best rank k approximation via the Singular Value Decomposition and the Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem.

-Strong background in numerical linear algebra is recommended with an intermediate understanding of algorithms.
